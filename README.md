# SimplePortalEffect
This project contains a simple portal effect made with ARKit and SceneKit. The portal effect is done with the inspector and with the code, both do the same thing.
    
Code version :
    This is an adaptation of the tutorial made by Jared Davidson : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuxXHAKA1WY. Rather than adding a surrounding box transparent, I used the colorBufferWriteMask to achieve the effect.

SceneKit inspector version :
    This is basically the same thing done by code, the only difference is that I used two materials (one for the occlusion and one standard).

Thanks to ARGeo for the detailed explanations in this post : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52910190/how-to-create-a-portal-effect-in-arkit-just-using-the-scenekit-editor/52911244#52911244.
